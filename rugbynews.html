      <h4 class="card-title">Six Nations will no longer be shown exclusively on free-to-air TV</h4>
      <img src="img/rugby1.jpg" alt="Six Nations" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">The 2019 Six Nations was potentially one of the last entire editions of the tournament to be exclusively shown on UK terrestrial TV.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The entire Six Nations championship will no longer be shown exclusively on free-to-air under a proposed £500m deal that will see CVC Capital Partners take a 15 per cent stake in the tournament which is currently shown in the UK by BBC and ITV under a five-year deal that ends in 2021.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">RugbyPass understands that a mixture of free-to-air and paid-for television exposure will be put in place in the UK, Ireland and France to enable CVC to maximise their involvement in Europe’s elite international competition. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Crucially, the November internationals staged by the Six Nations countries would also be part of the deal with those games coming into the equation when the free-to-air element is negotiated.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">That kind of cash windfall, allied to a commitment to keep some matches free-to-air, has convinced the Six Nations administration to make this momentous decision and each of the Unions is currently considering the proposal from CVC, who already own a 27 per cent share of the English Premiership that netted the top 12 clubs around £20m each.   
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The threat of the Six Nations being lost to Sky or BT in the lead-up to the current terrestrial deal signed in 2016 resulted in petitions being started demanding that what is seen as one of the jewels of the sporting crown in Europe was not hidden behind a pay-wall.

      <img src="img/rugby2.jpg" alt="Rugby Doping" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">South African lock Hendre Stassen is having a hard time of late. It was only last week that reports emerged that he had allegedly been involved in a fight back in his native country.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Now, comes an even more serious development, a provisional suspension while he organises his defence in a doping case brought by the French Agency for Fighting Doping.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The 21-year-old, who broke through at the Bulls before signing for Stade Francais for the 2018/19 season, was called for an unannounced check for the Montpellier-Stade match on May 19.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">One player was sanctioned for four years for Drostanolone and another four-year sanction was handed-down for Methandienone and Stanozolol. Two further cases are pending.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">World Rugby’s testing programme is run in partnership with unions, national and regional anti-doping organisations, with 66 per cent of tests conducted out of competition in line with the international federation’s intelligence and risk-based approach in elite rugby.

      <img src="img/rugby3.jpg" alt="Argentina World Cup Hopes" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">When Group C was drawn for the 2019 World Cup, comparisons were immediately drawn with 2015’s Pool A which was infamously referred to as the ‘Pool of Death’.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The presence of England, much improved since their disastrous 2015 tournament, France and last time semi-finalists Argentina suggests yet again there will be a pool where a big name will fail in 2019.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">In truth, however, a case for being called the ‘Pool of Death’ could be made for most of the pools in the upcoming finals in Japan.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Only Pool B looks reasonable straightforward for its top two seeded sides but even there, Italy should prove a much stronger opponent than in past tournaments. In Group A, Japan look a serious threat to Ireland and Scotland’s ambitions and Fiji could well edge out a shaky Australia or trouble Wales in Pool D.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">This World Cup should be the most competitive tournament we have had, with more than two teams per pool looking capable of qualifying for the knockout stages and the smaller nations suggesting they will prove tougher opposition than some of the decidedly one-sided games they have previously participated in.

      <img src="img/rugby4.jpg" alt="Will Addison" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">Joe Schmidt has added fit-again Will Addison to Ireland’s World Cup training squad. The Irish chose a 44-strong training squad at the end of May to prepare for the finals in Japan.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Addison’s name was missing from that list two months ago as he had eventually underwent back surgery in early April after failing to shake off the injury that has ruled him out of taking part in the Six Nations.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">It was reported at the time by Ulster that the expectation was for the player to be fit in time for pre-season training. That prognosis wasn’t enough to gain him incision in the original Irish RWC training squad, but he now made it back with preparations stepping up a notch.  
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Following an initial two-week window at their usual Carton House training base, Ireland are now on the road, training in Galway this week and moving onto Limerick next week. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Signed by Ulster last summer from Sale, Addison quickly forced his way into the Irish set-up and he featured in three of Ireland’s four November matches, including an 11th hour start in midfield against Argentina after Robbie Henshaw pulled up lame in the warm-up.

      <img src="img/rugby5.jpg" alt="Scotland Rugby" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">Former Scotland international John Jeffrey has been elected chairman of the Six Nations Council for a three-year term. He takes over from Pat Whelan, the former Ireland hooker, who had been chairman since April 2016. Jeffrey is the first Scottish chairman since Allan Hosie in the late 1990s/early 2000s.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Jeffrey hails from Kelso in the Scottish Borders and earned 40 caps for Scotland during his international career between 1984 and 1991. He was also selected for the British and Irish Lions in 1986 for their match against the Rest of the World and for the 1989 Tour to Australia.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">He has been a member of the Six Nations Council since 2012. Jeffrey has also represented Scottish Rugby at World Rugby since 2010 where he sits on the EXCO (from 2016) and chairs the Rugby Committee (from 2013).
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The former back row player has been a co-opted member of the Scottish Rugby Council since 2010, representing World Rugby and Six Nations.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Commenting on his appointment, Jeffrey, said: “It is a privilege to be elected Chairman of the Six Nations Council and to be involved in the development of Rugby’s Greatest Championship. I would like to take this opportunity to thank my predecessor Pat Whelan for his dedication over the last three years.”
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Scottish Rugby president Dee Bradbury added: “This is an excellent appointment and I’m delighted for JJ to now be in this role.” He has represented Scotland with great integrity at a global and local level for many years and his insight and counsel have always been of value. I’d like to wish him well in his new role and am pleased we have a Scottish representative in such a key position.”
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">France’s FFR president Bernard Laporte was also elected vice-chairman of the Six Nations Council.

      <img src="img/rugby6.jpg" alt="England U20 Rugby" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">England men’s under-20s head coach Steve Bates is to leave the RFU. After joining in 2017 the former Wasps scrum-half, who was capped for England, has decided to explore other exciting rugby related opportunities. A replacement will be announced in due course.
     </p>
     <p class="card-text">Bates has spent two years within the men’s pathway with responsibility for coaching and managing the under-20s’ programme, assisting in the development of many future full international players, some of which are in contention to represent England in the upcoming World Cup in Japan.
     </p>
     <p class="card-text">Speaking about his departure Bates said: “I have thoroughly enjoyed working alongside the pathway team and the RFU academies over the last two years and have been lucky enough to coach the under-20s in three World Rugby Under-20 Championships, reaching the final in two. 
     </p>
     <p class="card-text">“I wish the RFU, and particularly the pathway, all the best for the future and look forward to supporting England to victory in the World Cup in October. 
     </p>
     <p class="card-text">“I would like to thank Nigel (Melville, the RFU professional rugby director) and the team for the opportunity to experience the great depth of talent that England has at both under-20s and under-18s and am sure the pathway will go from strength to strength in the future.”
