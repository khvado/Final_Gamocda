      <img src="img/matthew.jpg" alt="Matthew" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">Matthew Wolff never quite reached the top spot in the World Amateur Golf Ranking—he can thank Oklahoma State teammate and fellow PGA Tour rookie Viktor Hovland for that—but he has already made a meteoric and historic rise in the Official World Golf Ranking thanks to his dramatic win at the 3M Open.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">When the new ranking was released on Monday morning, Wolff, who arrived in Minnesota as the 1,659th-ranked player in the world, moved up a whopping 1,524 spots. For those of you not good at math, Wolff is all the way up to No. 135. Quite the quick climb for the 20-year-old, to say the least.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Of course, it wasn't much of a surprise to see Wolff, who is one of the most hyped golfers to turn pro since Tiger Woods in 1996, get into the winner's circle. Although, to do it in just his third start as a pro exceeded even the most bullish projections for the reigning NCAA player of the year.

      <p class="card-text">This American - a qualifier, remember - is why Wimbledon 2019 will live long in the memory for all who have experienced it. She enjoyed a rise to stardom so rapid that she became the hottest ticket in town.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion and whose face adorns posters in Gauff's bedroom, called her an "absolute star". Her eventual conqueror, Simona Halep, said "she will be top 10 soon".
