      <img src="img/referee.jpg" alt="Referee" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">NEW YORK -- The NBA announced today that Jason Phillips, a top-rated referee with 19 seasons of officiating experience in the league, has been named Replay Center Operations Principal.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">In his new role, Phillips will be responsible for the day-to-day operations of the NBA Replay Center in Secaucus, N.J.  His Referee Operations duties will include creating training videos and interpreting the rules of the game for officials, teams, broadcasters and media.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">“We are excited to add an experienced and highly-respected official in Jason to our operations staff,” said NBA President, League Operations Byron Spruell. “We look forward to the continued success of the Replay Center under his leadership.” 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Phillips will be assisted in the Replay Center by Senior Lead Pete Williams, who has been a member of the Replay Center staff since September 2014.  In addition to game oversight, Williams creates training curricula, establishes protocol and assigns nightly responsibilities for all Replay Center personnel.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Phillips will succeed Senior Vice President, Replay and Referee Operations Joe Borgia, who has served the NBA for 30 years as a game official and a basketball and referee operations executive. Borgia was instrumental in the creation, design and implementation of the NBA’s state-of-the-art Replay Center.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Borgia will refocus his efforts and role with the NBA on the newly-created and recently-approved Coach’s Challenge. As he did with the Replay Center, Borgia will develop the rules and handle the execution of this important initiative.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">“Joe’s background, knowledge and experience make him a natural fit to lead the introduction and application of the Coach’s Challenge,” said Spruell. “After years of having Joe oversee the Replay Center nightly, we’re grateful that he will continue serving the NBA in such a pivotal role.”
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Phillips, 49, has officiated more than 1,100 regular-season games since joining the NBA for the 2000-01 season. He has also worked 94 NBA playoff games, including nine games in The Finals. He finished his on-court career officiating Games 1 and 5 of the 2019 NBA Finals.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">“After 19 years of experiencing NBA excitement on the court with the best officials in the world, I look forward to the new challenge of heading up the NBA Replay Center and working alongside the great people who help support our game on a daily basis,” said Phillips.  
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">A native of Cisco, Texas, Phillips earned a bachelor’s degree in Business Administration at Tarleton State University.

      <img src="img/porzingis.jpg" alt="Porzingis" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">DALLAS -- The Dallas Mavericks announced today that they have re-signed forward/center Kristaps Porzingis. Per team policy, terms of the deal were not disclosed.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Porzingis (7-3, 240) was originally acquired by the Mavericks on January 31, 2019 along with guards Tim Hardaway Jr., Courtney Lee and Trey Burke, in exchange for guard Dennis Smith Jr., center DeAndre Jordan, guard/forward Wesley Matthews and two future first-round draft picks.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">He holds career averages of 17.8 points, 7.1 rebounds, 2.0 blocks and 31.0 minutes per game in 186 games (185 starts). He averaged a career-high 22.7 points, 6.6 rebounds and a career-high 2.4 blocks in 48 games (all starts) for the Knicks during the 2017-18 season en route to being named a 2018 NBA All-Star. Porzingis suffered a torn left ACL against Milwaukee on Feb. 6, 2018, ending his 2017-18 campaign and he has not seen game action since the injury.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The former fourth overall pick in the 2015 NBA Draft appeared in 72 games (all starts) for the Knicks as a rookie in 2015-16, averaging 14.3 points, a career-high 7.3 rebounds and 1.9 blocks in 28.4 minutes on his way to being named to the 2016 NBA All-Rookie First Team. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">A native of Liepaja, Latvia, Porzingis began his professional career with Spain’s Cajasol Seville. He was a two-time recipient of the ACB All-Young Players Team (2014, 2015) and was also named a EuroCup Rising Star in 2015.

      <img src="img/lebron.jpg" alt="Lebron James" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">The Los Angeles Lakers intend to start four-time MVP LeBron James at point guard this season, according to a report from Chris Haynes of Yahoo Sports. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The 6-foot-8 forward reportedly will start alongside newly-signed veteran guard Danny Green in the Lakers' new-look backcourt. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">LeBron is no stranger to the point guard position. He has routinely filled the role as point-forward over his 16-year career. But this would be the first time a squad has planned to start him at point guard on opening night. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">He ranks 10th on the NBA's all-time assists list (8,662) and is within striking distance of passing a pair of Hall of Famers in 2019-20: Gary Payton (whom he trails by 305 assists) and Isiah Thomas (400).
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The Lakers have been busy this offseason adding talent to surround LeBron, who played a career-low 55 games last season and didn't reach The Finals for the first time since 2011. According to Haynes, the 34-year-old is in "great shape with no restrictions".

      <p class="card-text">According to multiple reports, an offer by the San Antonio Spurs to free-agent forward Marcus Morris has been pulled, leaving the eight-year veteran to sign a one-year, $15-million deal with the New York Knicks. The Spurs will reportedly opt instead for free-agent forward Trey Lyles.
     </p>
     <p class="card-text">Though it was originally reported that Morris intended to sign with the Spurs shortly after the business moratorium lifted on Saturday, word about a 'reconsideration' began bubbling on Tuesday. Charania reported that, despite the turn of events, Morris hopes for a clean break with San Antonio:

     <p class="card-text">Morris spent last the past two seasons with the Boston Celtics, serving as a standout reserve for them. In the 2018-19 season, Morris averaged 13.9 points, 6.1 rebounds and 1.5 assists per game.

     <p class="card-text">The 23-year-old Lyles is said to be set for a two-year deal with the Spurs, after spending the past two years as a member of the Denver Nuggets.
