      <h4 class="card-title">Djokovic and Federer's Sunday showdown could define how this rivalry is remembered</h4>
      <img src="img/djokovic.jpg" alt="Djokovic vs Federer" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">After witnessing the grandest of rivalries, we now look towards one far more difficult to define. Perhaps Sunday’s showdown will go some way to telling us how Roger Federer’s rivalry with Novak Djokovic will be remembered, writes Michael Hincks.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">It’s safe to say men’s semi-finals day at Wimbledon lived up to the hype. Never mind Sir Alex Ferguson, David Beckham, David Attenborough, Hugh Grant, Damian Lewis watching on, the real stars were the ones playing out on Centre Court.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Novak Djokovic did not canter to a sixth Wimbledon final, but was made to work against Roberto Bautista Agut, the Spanish 23rd seed who did not look phased in his first Grand Slam semi-final.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Bautista Agut had to postpone his Ibiza stag do after unexpectedly reaching the last four, and his friends watching on from the players’ box could have been forgiven for thinking the groom-to-be could become the best man on Friday.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">But after levelling at one-set all, Djokovic responded in champion style, reeling off the next two sets to move within one match of defending his crown and winning a 16th Grand Slam title.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Like two boxers sizing up their opponent, the pair tip-toed around in what was ultimately a cagey first set, with only one break point coming and going for Federer before it headed to a tie-break.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The shackles came off in a high-quality breaker, and the five points Federer reeled off in a row were enough to hand the 37-year-old the opening set.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Typically, Nadal responded in the second, and his decision to stand further back on Federer’s serve paid dividends as he broke twice to level it up at one-set all. Only one winner from here, right?
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Against expectations, Federer brushed off the disappointment of that 6-1 set and wrestled the initiative back, winning the lengthier rallies and baseline exchanges against a player so used to grinding his opponents down.

      <h4 class="card-title">Federer reaches 12TH Wimbledon final after topping Nadal in four sets</h4>
      <img src="img/federer.jpg" alt="Federer" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">The Swiss will contest his 12th championship match at the All England Club after winning the pair's 40th career clash.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Eleven years passed since Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer last met at Wimbledon, when Nadal prevailed to win the 2008 title in an iconic classic that stands the test of time.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">On Friday, the two reunited on Centre Court, meeting in the semifinal stage for the first time at the London major. The 37-year-old Federer saw off Nadal, 7-6 (3), 1-6, 6-3, 6-4, to improve his staggering last four record at the All England Club to an 11-1 mark. He defeated Nadal for the sixth time in seven meetings, ending his previous 0-4 record in major semifinals versus the Spaniard.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">“I’m exhausted. It was tough at the end,” Federer told the BBC afterwards. “Rafa played some unbelievable shots to stay in the match. I thought the match was played at a very high level. I enjoyed it. The crowd was amazing."
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">In Sunday’s championship, Federer will look to win a record-extending 21st major and ninth Wimbledon crown against world No. 1 Novak Djokovic. The Serbian leads their head-to-head series 25-22 and is 2-1 versus the Swiss at SW19. Federer, bidding to beat Nadal and Djokovic at the same major for the first time, leads the ATP tour with a 38-4 record this season. He has won 11 successive matches following his 10th Halle triumph and is aiming to win his 20th trophy on grass.  
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">“Novak is supreme. Again, he is defending champion. This week he’s been rock solid from start to finish so far,” said Federer. “He’s not just No. 1 by chance. He’s been so good for the last few years. I’m very, very excited to say the least.”

      <h4 class="card-title">Serena's commandingly balanced win left her one win from slam NO. 24</h4>
      <img src="img/serena.jpg" alt="Serena" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">Serena Williams likes Grand Slam semifinals; coming into her latest one, against Barbora Strycova, she was 31-5 in them. Even better, as far as she’s concerned, are Wimbledon semifinals. Before today, she was 10-1 in those. Her only loss came at the hands of her sister Venus in 2000, when Serena was a teenager. By the time she reaches the the final four, it seems, she can see the finish line, but she’s not yet nervous about having to cross it.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Serena was sensational in the semis again on Thursday. She beat Strycova 6-1, 6-2 with a commandingly balanced and thorough attack. She hit 28 winners to Strycova’s eight, and made just 10 errors. She was 13 of 16 at the net; included in that total were a few deft drop volleys that could have come straight out of one of her mixed-doubles matches with Andy Murray. While she had just four aces, she was 24 of 27 on her first-serve points. She was four of five on break points, and saved all three break points against her. Serena even won more than half of the points on Strycova’s serve.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Serena won cat-and-mouse points at the net, she tracked down drop shots and flicked them for winners, she hooked crosscourt forehand passes and drilled down-the-line backhand passes. When Strycova helped hand her a break at 1-1 in the first set with a botched drop shot, Serena relaxed, and her first-serve percentage immediately rose. Later in the first set, after going down 0-40 in one of her service games, she clamped down and won five points in a row. She closed the set as she has closed so many before, with an ace.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">According to Serena, she was occupying just the right mental space in this match.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">“I was calm today,” Serena said. “It’s a day-to-day basis for me....I definitely feel like I play better when I’m calm. But it’s definitely an effort. Not getting over-pumped, but at the same time, not getting under-wound. I have to be in that right space.”
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">She also said that playing mixed doubles had helped sharpen her volley, and given her the confidence to come forward.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">“I kept telling you guys I thought the doubles would help me,” Serena said. “I really think it did. I don’t attack the net that much; I tried to and I want to.”

      <img src="img/murray.jpg" alt="Andy Murray" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">Andy Murray has ruled himself out of returning to singles action at next month's US Open.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The Scot had originally aimed for Flushing Meadows and the preceding hard court events but has since altered his opinion as he continues his comeback from "life-changing" hip surgery.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"It's pretty unlikely, just in terms of timings," he said. "I spoke to my team about that and there is still a lot of stuff I need to get done physically and get myself stronger
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"The amount of work that I need to do on the court to get ready for singles, and the amount I need to put in off the court to get myself strong enough and ready to play best-of-five sets, it's still quite a way away unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"I would love to play but I need to look like pretty long-term at this. I don't want to be having to go through another big operation in a few years' time.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"I want to make sure the operation I've had lasts for as long as possible and to give it the best chance I need to make sure I am physically really strong before I get back on the singles court."
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Murray and Serena Williams' partnership continued to blossom on Wimbledon Centre Court as they won their second-round mixed-doubles match on Tuesday.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">But while Murray sees no reason why he cannot return to the top of men's tennis, he admits his return to singles action could take longer than initially expected.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"You guys want a timeframe but I can't give you an exact one because I don't know how long it's going to take for me to physically get to that level," he said.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"I know some people might like it to have taken five or six months but it's going to take more time than that unfortunately.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"Whether that's nine, 12 or 18 months, I don't know. I'll do my best to make it as soon as I can. I can't give an exact timeframe on this. It's tough."

      <img src="img/halep.jpg" alt="Halep" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">Simona Halep was on her game on Centre Court on Thursday, cruising past Elina Svitolina—one of her toughest match-ups on the tour—to reach her first career Wimbledon final.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Not only had Svitolina won four of the pair's last six meetings, but she'd barely lost the two she didn't win, having led 6-3 5-1 in a 3-6, 7-6 (6), 6-0 loss at the French Open back in 2017, and leading 4-1 in the third set of a 6-3, 3-6, 6-4 defeat in Doha earlier this year.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The first two games of this match were tight, too—they lasted 20 minutes—but Halep won them both, and after 43 minutes the No. 7 seed had the first set in her pocket, 6-1. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">The second set was closer as the two stayed on serve through 3-all, but Halep snuck out the first break of the set for a 4-3 lead, held for 5-3 and broke again for the match, closing it out, 6-1, 6-3, after the No. 8-seeded Svitolina hit one last backhand into the net. 
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Halep is now the first Romanian woman ever to reach the Wimbledon final.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"Well it's an amazing feeling," Halep told the BBC. "I'm really excited. I'm also nervous. It's one of the best moments of my life, so I'm just trying to enjoy it as much as possible."
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">As the two women slugged it out from the baseline, they both produced the same amount of unforced errors—16—but Halep hit more than twice as many winners as Svitolina, 26 to 10.

      <img src="img/coco.jpg" alt="Coco" class="responsive">
      <p class="card-text">Her Wimbledon run was so extraordinary that Serena Williams and Andy Murray had to cancel their plans.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">"It was definitely the best week of my life," Coco Gauff told the BBC - few 15-year-olds will have had better.

      <p class="card-text">This American - a qualifier, remember - is why Wimbledon 2019 will live long in the memory for all who have experienced it. She enjoyed a rise to stardom so rapid that she became the hottest ticket in town.
      </p>
      <p class="card-text">Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam champion and whose face adorns posters in Gauff's bedroom, called her an "absolute star". Her eventual conqueror, Simona Halep, said "she will be top 10 soon".
